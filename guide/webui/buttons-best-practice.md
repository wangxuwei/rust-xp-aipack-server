## UI Buttons Best Practices

These are the best practices for buttons

### Buttons in html


````html
<button class="btn-edit"></button>
<button class="action-edit"></button>
<button class="btn-edit prime"></button>
<button class="btn-edit danger"></button>
<button class="btn-edit main-button"></button>
````

- try to see the context, try to add class for events to select with prefix "btn-" or "action-" prefix, if not sure, just add "btn-" by default
- then for second class, the main button is larger and circle, the "prime" color should be for "Prime", the danger is for "red" which do dangerous things, for example delete some thing
